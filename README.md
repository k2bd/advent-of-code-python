## Installation

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and `poetry install` the project.

## Running

(Note: if Poetry is managing a virtual environment for you, you may need to use `poetry run poe` instead of just `poe`)

### Setting up boilerplate

Set up some boilerplate for a day using `poe boiler`.

For example: `poe boiler 2020 1`

### Getting test input

To get the test input for a particular puzzle, use `poe get-input` followed by year and day.

For example: `poe get-input 2020 1`

You must have the `AOC_SESSION` or `AOCD_DIR` environment variables set for this to work.
For more information see [advent-of-code-data](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/).

### Getting a solution

To run a particular puzzle, use `poe solve` followed by year and day.

For example: `poe solve 2020 1`
